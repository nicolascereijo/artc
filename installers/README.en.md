# **ARtC — Installation Guide (Linux and Windows)**

This project includes local installers that configure a fully isolated Python 3.12 environment inside the project directory, without modifying the operating system's Python installation or global configuration.

The process is fully portable and works on both Linux and Windows 10/11.

---

## Contents Generated by the Installer

Each installer performs the following steps:

1. Downloads a local copy of Python 3.12.x inside the project
2. Creates an internal virtual environment named `.artc`
3. Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
4. Installs the project package itself using `pip install .`
5. Cleans temporary build files
6. Does not modify any global system configuration

# **Installation on Linux**

## Requirements

The following tools must be installed:

- gcc
- make
- tar
- curl or wget

On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential curl
```

On Fedora/RHEL:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc make tar wget
```

---

## Installation

Run the Linux installer:

```bash
./installers/artc-install-linux.sh
```

If it does not have execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x installers/artc-install-linux.sh
```

---

## Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
source .artc/bin/activate
```

## Deactivate the Environment

```bash
deactivate
```

---

# **Installation on Windows (10 and 11)**

Installation on Windows is performed through a `.bat` launcher, which executes the internal PowerShell script without requiring changes to the system's execution policy.

Administrator privileges are not required.

---

## Installation

Run:

```
installers\artc_install_windows.bat
```

This launcher will automatically invoke:

```
installers\artc_install_windows_core.ps1
```

with `ExecutionPolicy Bypass` applied only during this run.

---

## Activate the Virtual Environment

In PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.artc\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

In CMD:

```cmd
.artc\Scripts\activate.bat
```

---

## Deactivate the Environment

In PowerShell:

```powershell
deactivate
```

In CMD:

```cmd
.artc\Scripts\deactivate.bat
```

## Important Notes

- None of the installers require root/administrator privileges.
- The system's Python installation is not modified.
- On Windows, global execution policies remain unchanged.
- All generated content lives inside the project directory and can be safely deleted at any time.
